          The idea of this guide is to explore JSX, styling and state management in React, by creating a resposive and interactive webpage. We'll use create-react-app to setup the project.

          Install the latest recommended version of <ContentCoreLink href='https://nodejs.org/en/' target='_blank'  rel="noopener noreferrer"> Node.js </ContentCoreLink>

          <ContentCoreCommand>
            $ npx create-react-app jsexpert-rendering

There are some files which are unnecessary for this guide. You can leave them if you want, but if you're interested in cleaning up, you may do the following.
        </ContentCoreText>
        <ContentCoreText>
          Inside the src folder, delete App.test.js, index.css, logo.svg, serviceWorker.js and setupTests.js
        </ContentCoreText>
        <ContentCoreText>
          White this code in index.js
        </ContentCoreText>
        <ContentCoreText>
          And this code in App.js
        </ContentCoreText>
        <ContentCoreText>
          If you find yourself deleting these files too often, you can alternatively clone this <a  href='https://google.com' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a>. Service workers and testes are important for projects in production, but for guides like this one, they can be removed.

          For each IntersectionObserverEntry in the list entries, we look to see if the entry's intersectionRatio is going up; if it is, we set the target's background-color to the string in increasingColor (remember, it's "rgba(40, 40, 190, ratio)"), replaces the word "ratio" with the entry's intersectionRatio. The result: not only does the color get changed, but the transparency of the target element changes, too; as the intersection ratio goes down, the background color's alpha value goes down with it, resulting in an element that's more transparent.
